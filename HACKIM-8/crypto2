## Crypto Challenge - 2
The question was  



```Breaking Bad Key Exchange
Hint 1 : in the range (1 to g*q), there are couple of pairs yielding common secrete as 399.
Hint 2 : 'a' and 'b' both are less than 1000.
```  

Also there was an image given with the challenge which gave me the algorithm to write my code straigtaway

This was pretty simple. Just write a quick python code.  

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

a=[]
b=[]



for x in range (1000):
	if (10**x % 541 == 298):
		a.append(x)

for y in range(1000):
	if (10**y % 541 == 330):
		b.append(y)

for value in a,b:
	print value
  ```  
      ```Output :  
      [170, 710]
      [268, 808]
      ```
  
The flag was the commbination of the value in a and b. You might have to check for 4 combinations. And the below worked. 
###Flag:  


    flag{170, 808}
